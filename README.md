Welcome to The Iron Yard's Lunch 'n' Learn. We'll be making an Instagram clone in HTML and CSS.

## Course Resources
You'll need these resources to follow along with the class:

### Codepen
Codepen is a free online application to play around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll need to set up an account at www.codepen.io.

### Example Site
We've created an example site for you to inspect before we start live coding. Go to the URL https://tinydinosaurs.github.io/unicornstagram/.

### Google Fonts
Google has a bunch of free fonts you can use to customize your designs. Check them out at https://fonts.google.com.

### Font Awesome
Font Awesome is another free resource that provides icon fonts. We'll talk a little about these later. Check out the icons at http://fontawesome.io.
